## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of a failed new release. I have:

* Resolved missing package anchors for Rd files.
* Don't run long-running example (slightly more than 10s) in 'telework_data.Rd'.
* However, the notes on potential misspelling remain - I could remove 'Heckman', but 'Probit'/'probit' is an important keyword (which also triggers misspelling concerns).
