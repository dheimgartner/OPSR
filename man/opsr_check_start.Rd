\usage{
opsr_check_start(start, W, Xs)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{vector of starting values.}

\item{W}{matrix with explanatory variables for selection process.}

\item{Xs}{list of matrices with expalanatory varialbes for outcome process for each regime.}
}
\description{
This is a utility function, used in \code{\link{opsr}} and should not be used directly.
It is included here to document the expected structure of \code{\link{opsr}}'s \code{start} argument.
Makes sure, the start vector conforms to the expected structure. Adds the
expected parameter names to the numeric vector. Therefore the user has to
conform to the expected order. See 'Details' for further explanation.
}
\details{
Expected order: 1. kappa threshold parameters (for ordinal probit model),
2. parameters of the selection process, 3. parameters of the outcome processes,
4. sigma, 5. rho. If the same outcome process specification is used in the
\code{formula}, the starting values have to be repeated (i.e., the length of the
\code{start} vector has to correspond to the total number of estimated parameters
in the model).
